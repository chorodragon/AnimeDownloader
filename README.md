Little script for automatic download seasonal anime from [HorribleSubs.info](https://horriblesubs.info/)

Script work in order:
1. Parse Rss Feed
2. Search for the animes the user wants (animes defined on animeList.txt)
3. See if episode hasn't been downloaded yet
4. If it hasn't been downloaded, then add it to transmission-daemon
